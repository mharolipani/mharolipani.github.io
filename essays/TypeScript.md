It’s been a while since I’ve last coded thanks to life’s circumstances and distractions. Despite stressing myself out to speedrun the “Introduction to Javascript” on freeCodeCamp; so I could then rush through “W3Schools Typescript Tutorial”. The sense of familiarity it has to C++ and Java (being its namesake), allowed me to give myself a sigh of relief starting off my endeavors, as I retained common sense to double check semicolons and curly braces. Typescript, as I've learned, makes it easier to double-check errors within the code before reformatting back into Javascript, a feature that the previous languages taught to me employed through try/catch statements that one needed to remember to implement for each Class and Function. ES6 on the other hand, I’ve only given the bare minimum of attention to at the moment so I can’t fully recall any of the features it tried to teach me as I rushed to finish that part of our E07a assignment. 
  
As I regard myself as a novice programmer, I doubt I yet possess the proper thought processes of a Software Engineer. My knowledge of Javascript is so bare, I can’t say I know if Typescript executes its purpose dutifully since I never experienced the woes of Javascript in its heyday. I was told what it was designed to do, and was shown evidence in class. Without extensive use of the tool myself, I can’t really say what I think about it other than it just works. 
However, it being the first code I've learned in a while has been an enjoyable experience, especially because of our WODs. I took ICS 111, 211, 212 and Discrete Mathematics back when Covid-19 caused classes to move online. Many hours were spent studying, yet I’ve felt nothing was learned during that time. Hours and hours of staring at my white IDE’s for Java and Emacs, wasted. 

Back then my mind lacked an eagerness for learning, but because of how my mind has changed since then and ASE, I was able to get at least the basics down of Javascript in a couple of days. Before, my room was filled with lo-fi tunes that made me feel relaxed and gave me the sense that I was able to learn. Now, my hallway echoes with the screaming sounds of “Le Castle Vania” as I’m determined to get through assignments in an efficient and timely manner. 
Am I stressed? Of course I am, but I expected to because it’s been a while since my last CS class. Am I enjoying this? Heck yeah because I am learning. Life has always thrown challenges at me and I’ve always exited through the backdoor when things got rough. This time, Nah, I’d win.
