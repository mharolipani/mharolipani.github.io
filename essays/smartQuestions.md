Asking dumb questions doesn’t make you stupid, it means you lack common sense. Why on our blue and green Earth, would someone dare to ask a Mechanic a question that a doctor would be better suited to answer, or a Chemistry teacher about how to get out of jury duty? For legal queries, one should better call Saul. While it may seem harmless to ask a question out of generality, it’s not the first person who asks, but the nth person that ends up wasting precious time. Smart questions, as stated by Eric Raymond in “How to ask smart questions”, should be clear and precise, thought provoking, and most importantly relevant to who you’re asking. 

Let’s look at two examples:
Starting off with a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78925217/text-to-speech-using-google-instead-of-default-samsung-configuration\">bad example</a>; in this post asked by user Vladimir B, with his header “text to speech using Google instead of Samsung configuration”. Unfortunately, Vladimir B's question was closed due to not having met the specific requirements of Stack Overflow to be considered a good question. Given his name and sentence structure, the logical assumption is that he is lazy as Eric Raymond suggests, or that english isn't Vlad's first language. Regardless, no effort was contributed to his query, most likely because at the end the question he asks, "So question how to set TTS engine in Microsoft.Maui.Media TextToSpeech prior to calling SpeakAsync?" which when searched on google, Microsoft itself has a page to answer questions regarding it. The issue here is more of a language problem. 

Moving onto the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63034484/how-to-create-stream-which-handles-both-input-and-output-in-c">second post</a> by Akib Azmain Turja meets more of the requirements of what is a Smart question, or at least enough that it isn’t taken off of Stack Overflow. His header is question that’s asks right away what he needs, followed by an clear concise explanation of what he’s trying to accomplish, what he knows and has tried so far. He doesn’t post all of his code, just the lines he’s having an issue with, and doesn’t end the post open ended but by asking “How can one create a stream with custom functionalities?” With all the thought and effort put into his post, user Akib Azmain Turja isn’t given the direct answers but is given directions on from other user’s such as John, user20574, and Antonio. Akib later responds to his own question, in detail, and is told by another user Tanveer Badar that he posted an amazing explanation. This post leaves behind something that later viewers might learn from or apprciate.
